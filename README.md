# React Native Async Operation Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations within lifecycle methods. The `Bug.js` file showcases the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

**Problem:** The component attempts to render before the asynchronous operation (data fetching) completes, leading to undefined values and potentially crashes.

**Solution:** The corrected code utilizes the `useEffect` hook with a cleanup function and the `async/await` syntax to handle asynchronous data fetching and prevent race conditions.  It also uses state management to ensure the component renders only when data is available.
